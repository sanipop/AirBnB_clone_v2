## Database Schema

The project uses a relational database schema to store various entities and their relationships. Below is a simplified overview of the database schema:

- **Users:** Stores information about registered users, such as username, email, password hash, and profile details.
- **Properties:** Contains details about listed properties, including location, amenities, pricing, and host information.
- **Bookings:** Records bookings made by users, including the property booked, booking dates, and guest information.
- **Reviews:** Stores reviews and ratings submitted by users for properties they have stayed at.

For a more detailed schema, please refer to the SQL database schema file (`schema.sql`) included in the project.

## Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sanipop/AirBnB_clone_v2.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd AirBnB_clone_v2.git'
3. Set up your SQL database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
